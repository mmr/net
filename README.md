Sharing wifi with 5 other people at home?

Net should help you raise the awareness about each others consumption.
And, indirectly, let you perceive if there are devices with some crazy
spyware/spambot/virus installed, consuming your entire bandwidth by
silently downloading the Internet, leaving nothing for the others.

## Impl details
Right now it is a very simple chrome plugin that talks directly to the wifi
router and collects the download/upload statistics and shows it in a nice pie
chart.

Supported routers:
- TP-LINK TL-WR941ND
